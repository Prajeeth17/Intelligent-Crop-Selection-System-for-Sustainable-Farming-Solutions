# Intelligent Crop Selection System for Sustainable Farming Solutions

## Problem Statment:
Choosing the right crop based on soil and climate conditions is crucial for farmers. Poor crop selection leads to significant challenges:
<ul>
<li>Global Food Waste: Approximately 1.3 billion tons of food are wasted annually (FAO), with 25-30% of crops lost in India alone.</li>
<li>Economic Losses: Crop failures result in financial hardships, increasing dependency on loans.</li>
<li>Environmental Degradation: Overusing fertilizers and water depletes soil nutrients and harms ecosystems.</li>
<li>Food Insecurity: Rising global populations threaten food supply chains, leading to hunger.</li>
<li>Increased Carbon Footprint: Inefficient farming practices contribute to climate change.</li>
</ul>

Addressing these issues through informed crop selection can transform agriculture, enhance food security, and promote sustainability.
